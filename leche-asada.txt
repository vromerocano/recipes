Leche Asada Recipe:



Ingredients

   
- 1 qt whole milk   
- 4 eggs   
- 1 lemon, zest cut off in 1/2-inch-wide strips   
- 1/2 cup white sugar  
- 2 cinnamon sticks   
- 1/2 cup pisco (optional)



Directions


1. Preheat oven to 175 Celsius


2. Pour the milk into a saucepan along the lemon zest and cinnamom sticks. 
Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low, and cook for 5 
minutes. Turn heat off, and allow to steep for 15 minutes.


3. Gently beat the eggs and sugar together until the sugar has dissolved. Slowly 
beat 1 cup of the hot milk, a little at a time, until it has been incorporated. 
Stir the egg mixture back into the hot milk, pour the pisco, and mix until well 
combined.


4. Pour the custard throug a fine mesh sieve into a 2-quart ceramic casserole 
dish to remove the lemon zest and cinnamon. Bake in preheated oven until set, and 
browned on top, about 30 minutes. Chill before serving.
